A lightweight console built with React and TypeScript for triaging and converting Leads into Opportunities. This project was developed as a frontend challenge, focusing on code structure, componentization, and client-side state management.

## Features

* **Lead Listing**: Loads and displays a list of leads from a local JSON file.
* **Search and Filters**:
    * Dynamic search by lead name or company name.
    * Filter by lead status (`New`, `Contacted`, `Qualified`, `Lost`).
    * Automatic sorting of the list by `score` (descending).
* **Add Leads**: Opens a modal with a form to add new leads to the list.
* **Details Panel**: Clicking on a lead displays a slide-over panel, allowing the editing of information such as email and status.
* **Lead Conversion**: A lead can be converted into an "Opportunity," moving it from the leads list to a new opportunities table.
* **Pagination**: Both the Leads and Opportunities tables have pagination controls to efficiently handle large volumes of data.
* **UI States**: The interface handles loading, empty, and error states.

## üíª Tech Stack

* **Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
